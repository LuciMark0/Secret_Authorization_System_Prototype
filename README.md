# Secret Authorization System Prototype

The Secret Authorization System Prototype is a proof-of-concept application that aims to provide a brief understanding of the Secret Authorization System. It demonstrates the core functionalities of a group management system, focusing on transparency, team effectiveness, and decision-making through voting. This prototype serves as an initial implementation to showcase the potential of the Secret Authorization System.

## Key Features

- **Authority Points**: Accurately determine the impact of each member's authority on decision-making using an authority points system. Assign unique points to each member, reflecting their level of expertise and influence within the group. These authority points provide a comprehensive representation of each member's standing within the team.

- **Secret Vote System**: Maintain objectivity and fairness during decision-making with a robust secret vote system. Participate in anonymous voting sessions at regular intervals, where members express their support or opposition to proposed decisions. By eliminating personal biases and influences, this system ensures a fair evaluation process. Customize the frequency of voting sessions to suit your group's preferences and needs.

- **Decision Creation**: Enable members to create decisions within the Secret Authorization System. Members can initiate decision proposals, providing details and rationale for each decision. This feature allows the group to collaborate and discuss new ideas effectively. Once a decision is proposed, it goes through the voting process to determine its acceptance.

- **Decision Voting**: During the decision voting process, each member casts their vote, expressing support or opposition. If the cumulative points for a decision are positive at the end of the voting session, it is accepted. Set custom thresholds to establish specific criteria for decision acceptance, aligning the decision-making process with your group's unique dynamics and priorities.

## Usage

The Secret Authorization System Prototype provides a user-friendly interface for managing group permissions, collaboration, and decision-making. Here are some usage examples:

- **Managing Group Permissions**: Use the Secret Authorization System to define and manage group permissions effectively. Assign authority points to each member based on their expertise and influence within the group. This ensures that decisions are made with the input of the most qualified and influential individuals.

- **Collaboration and Discussion**: Initiate decision proposals within the system to encourage collaboration and discussion among group members. Provide details and rationale for each decision, allowing the team to exchange ideas and provide valuable feedback. This feature promotes transparency and inclusivity within the group.

- **Voting on Decisions**: Engage in the voting process to express your support or opposition to proposed decisions. Each member's vote is weighted based on their authority points, ensuring a fair evaluation of each decision. The system calculates the cumulative points and determines the acceptance or rejection of a decision based on custom thresholds set by the group.

- **Customization and Flexibility**: Customize the Secret Authorization System Prototype to align with your group's unique dynamics and priorities. Adjust the frequency of voting sessions to suit your team's needs and preferences. Set specific criteria for decision acceptance to reflect the decision-making process that best fits your group.
